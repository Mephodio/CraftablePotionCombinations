# CraftablePotionCombinations
Enables combining Potions through the Crafting Grid!

Minecraft insists on *never* changing the inventory size, which makes Potion usage a pain! Whos going to spare 3 inventory slots to carry one each of Water Breathing, Night Vision, and Regen? Save yourself the inventory space by combining these Potions. The downside is you'll obviously be forced to consume all 3 at once, but that's the trade-off!
